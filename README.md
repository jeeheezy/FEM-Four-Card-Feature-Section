## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It was my first time dealing with a single side border stylization. I was a bit confused since the border-radius curved the ends of the styled and colored border as well, so the simplest way of avoiding this issue I could find was creating a separate div over the cards to add the border-radius.

### Continued development

I still haven't had too much experience with CSS Grid, so I'd like to get a bit more experience with using the layouts.
